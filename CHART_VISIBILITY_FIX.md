# ✅ Chart Visibility Fix

## Problem
Charts were not visible despite API returning 200 status codes. The issue was a data format mismatch between API route and the chart component.

## Root Cause
The API route (`app/api/chart/route.ts`) was trying to access `item.time` and `item.value` from the response, but `lib/market.ts` was already returning the data in the new format with `timestamp`, `close`, `high`, `low`, `open` fields.

## Fix Applied

### `app/api/chart/route.ts`
**Before:**
```typescript
data: result.data.map(item => ({
  timestamp: new Date(item.time).getTime(),  // ❌ item.time doesn't exist
  close: item.value,                         // ❌ item.value doesn't exist
  // ...
}))
```

**After:**
```typescript
data: result.data, // ✅ Already in correct format from lib/market.ts
```

### Added 5Y Support
- Added `'5y'` to the schema validation enum

## Data Flow (Fixed)

```
lib/market.ts
  ↓ Returns
{ timestamp: number, close: number, high: number, low: number, open: number }
  ↓
app/api/chart/route.ts
  ↓ Returns (unchanged - already correct format)
{ timestamp: number, close: number, high: number, low: number, open: number }
  ↓
components/charts/StockChart.tsx
  ↓ Renders
Charts with proper data! ✅
```

## What to Test

1. Visit `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`
2. Check if charts display properly for any stock
3. Try different ranges (1D, 5D, 1M, 6M, 1Y, 5Y)
4. Verify charts show price data instead of "No chart data"

Charts should now be visible! 🎉
