# âœ… Dashboard Watchlist Integration - Complete!

## What Was Added

The dashboard now displays your actual watchlist instead of "Watchlist functionality coming soon".

## Features

### 1. **Real-Time Watchlist Display**
- Shows up to 5 stocks from your watchlist
- Loads data from localStorage (persists across sessions)
- Displays price and % change for each stock

### 2. **Interactive Cards**
- Click any stock card to view its detailed chart
- Color-coded indicators (green for gains, red for losses)
- Real-time price updates every 30 seconds

### 3. **Quick Actions**
- "View All â†’" button to see full watchlist
- "Add Stocks" button if watchlist is empty

### 4. **Smart Data Loading**
- Only loads watchlist after client mounts (no hydration errors)
- Falls back to default stocks if watchlist is empty
- Shows loading skeletons while fetching data

## Visual Design

- Modern card-based layout
- Smooth hover effects
- Clean, minimal design matching the app's aesthetic

## Where to Find It

Visit: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`

Look for the "My Watchlist" section in the lower part of the dashboard.

## How It Works

1. **Loads from localStorage** - Your watchlist is saved and persists
2. **Fetches batch quotes** - Gets prices for all stocks in your watchlist
3. **Displays top 5** - Shows the first 5 stocks from your list
4. **Click to view** - Click any stock to see its chart

Your dashboard is now fully functional! ðŸŽ‰
